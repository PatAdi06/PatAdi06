##Hi there, I'm Adi! 👋
Computer Science Student | Software Engineering Enthusiast | ML Enjoyer

I'm a 2nd-year Computer Science student at Brunel University and am passionate about building meaningful software and exploring how Machine Learning can be applied to solve real-world problems. I am currently learning about the basics of Web Development, as well as building a project in a group about a solution to solve a UN Sustainable Development Goal (Industry, innovation and infrastructure).
